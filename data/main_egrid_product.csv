1,N95 Mask," N95 respirator is a particulate-filtering facepiece respirator that meets the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) N95 standard of air filtration, meaning that it filters at least 95% of airborne particles.","Quality compliant with standards, including for fluid resistance level and breathability (differential pressure):
• EN 14683 Type IIR performance, or
• ASTM F2100 level 2 or level 3,
or equivalent.",https://static.grainger.com/rp/s/is/image/Grainger/3KP43_AS01?$zmmain$,""
2,Full Length Disposable Face Shields,"Protective mask with a lifting cover, attached to the band with screws and a knob for adjusting cover. The mask has two velcro straps, both on the back and from the top of the head allowing a perfect fit of the mask to the head. The strap has a soft foam ","colorless resistant to alcohol-based disinfectants,
white PCV headband with smooth adjustment",https://cdn.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shield-1.jpg#_ga=2.77018133.1410936239.1587491028-761891983.1587491028,https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/covid-19-prusa
3,Ventilator,"A ventilator is a machine that provides mechanical ventilation by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs, to deliver breaths to a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently. Modern ventilators are computerized microprocessor-controlled machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated bag valve mask. Ventilators are chiefly used in intensive-care medicine, home care, and emergency medicine (as standalone units) and in anesthesiology (as a component of an anesthesia machine).","The Savina 300 SW 5.0 offers advanced features such as automatic tube compensation (ATC) to aid clinicians in their daily workflow, and improve patient comfort by reducing artificial airway resistance.

Operating independently from a central power and gas supply, the Savina 300 SW 5.0 enables a high degree of flexibility for mechanically ventilated patients in long-term facilities and acute care facilities alike.",https://a360-rtmagazine.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ventilator_Drager_Savina300SD_1500-1200x773.jpg,
4,Medical glove,"Medical gloves are disposable gloves used during medical examinations and procedures to help prevent cross-contamination between caregivers and patients. Medical gloves are made of different polymers including latex, nitrile rubber, polyvinyl chloride and neoprene; they come unpowdered, or powdered with corn starch to lubricate the gloves, making them easier to put on the hands.","Based on the ASTM D3577-01a standards, surgical gloves must have a minimum tensile strength of 24
MPa even after the sterilization process as specified by ISO 13485: 2003 and ISO 11137-2 standard. In
these experiments, the RVNRL films were irradiated at doses of 25, 30 and 35 kGy and the observed
effects of high irradiation dose on mechanical and physical properties. Exposure to high irradiation dose
will slightly change the colour of the RVNRL films and affect the tensile strength.",https://area-info.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Surgical-Gloves.jpg,
