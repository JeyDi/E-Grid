# E-Grid
European Emergency Grid


### What Inspired Us?
The crisis showed how people can efficiently organize at a local level to support their community and medical equipment needs. 
However, this can't easily scale to regional, national, and european level. Moreover, industries can join the effort too, 
by making their infrastructure available and switching their production to goods that are needed to fight the emergency.
This solution will help both communities, which will have more medical equipment available in a shorter time, 
and also industries that will have an alternative way to maintain their production in case of shortage of the demand caused by the emergency. 
To support international collaboration and give an alternative income solution to industries, we propose E-Grid (European Emergency Grid). 


### What E-Grid brings to the table?
E-Grid is a solution that will allow a quick, and coordinated effort to handle the production of necessary medical (and other important) products in case of new emergencies.
Moreover, the system will allow for companies to find new suppliers after the emergency. 
During emergencies, PAs can require a higher priority on special goods like medical supplies. The system will allow different level
of authorities, from local, to national and european level. This hierarchy will allow to avoid competition from same level authorities.
Companies that are able to re-design their production will be able to increase the supply of the good required to fight the emergency.
Which will allow them to maintain an income. After the emergency, companies could find new suppliers (and clients) in case their old ones are
not on the market anymore, or if their production drastically reduced.

### E-Grid impact on the crisis?
Our proposal will allow to better handle future crisis by reducing the time required from the front line to the production facilities.
