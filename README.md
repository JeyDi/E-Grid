# E-Grid
European Emergency Grid


### What Inspired Us?
The crisis showed how people can efficiently organize at a local level to support their community and medical equipment needs. 
However, this can't easily scale to regional, national, and european level. Moreover, industries can join the effort too, 
by making their infrastructure available and  switch their production to products that are needed to fight the emergency.
This solution will help both the community, which will have more medical equipment available with a shorted delay, 
and also industries that will have a way to reduce their losses due to the shortage of demand. 
To support international collaboration and give an alternative income solution to industries, we developed E-Grid (European Emergency Grid). 


### What E-Grid brings to the table?
E-Grid is a solution that will allow a quick, and coordinated effort to handle the production of necessary medical products in case of new emergencies.
